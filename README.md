Technology is evolving with every passing second, making our lives faster and more efficient. Currently every person at a shopping mall purchases the product placed in the trolley. Upon purchase, the person must stand in a que for billing. In the billing process the employee scans the barcode of each product and bills it to the final. This process can be extremely tiresome, laborious and time consuming. To over come this, a smart way of shopping has been developed. Each product has an RFID tag instead of a barcode. The smart cart would feature an RFID reader and an LCD module. When the customer scans it, the products’s name, cost and expiration will be displayed. The bill is stored in the microcontroller’s memory and once the purchase is complete, the purchase details are sent to the customer through the GSM module. Arduino IDE software tool is used for programming and proteus software is used to check simulation results before hardware implementation.
